## Timetable

10'00 - 17'00: Active coding time (we will have lunch and you are welcome to take as many breaks as you want) <br />
17'00 - 18'00: Presentations <br />
18'00 - 18'30: Break - time for judges to discuss prizes <br />

## The challenge
The 2023 challenge has 2 phases: <br />
    * Phase 1: **The black hole basics** 
    Jupyter Notebook (made by the amazing Dr. Carolin Villforth - with some slight changes regarding the updated data sets and certain code lines). The submission of this notebook is mandatory for arriving in phase 1. The time alloted for coding should be sufficient for the submission of this complete notebook, therefore the completition of the notebook will be used as the requirement for the participation award. <br />
    * Phase 2: **Extensions:** Show us what you can do! 
    4 extensions are proposed for this section, but you are welcome to amaze us with other extensions.
    Phase 2 is designed for more advanced students. It is a space for you to explore black hole data and mechanics further, and showcase your skills to the judges.

## GitHub instructions
If you have never contributed to a Github repo here are some instructions: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project 
Feel free to ask the committee for help if you need it!

## Judging criteria
1) You must submit a filled and working Phase 1 notebook: 80% completition is the requirement. Please do reach out to the committee during the event if you are really struggling.
2) Teams will present their results during the presentation round. The presentation time will depend on the number of teams, but for now we estimate presentations to be 10 minutes.
3) Presentations must consist of the extension work. They will be judged based on originality and quality of the work.
4) The code as well as the result presentation will be judged equality.
Be original! Have fun! And collaborate with like-minded incredible young scientists!
