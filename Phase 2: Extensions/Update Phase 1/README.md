You can also add more tasks! 

*Note: Phase 1 was originally created as an outreach task for the department. If you update or extend it, we would be happy to connect you with Carolin so she can use this new work in future outreach activities! You would get full credit for the updates, of course, and may contribute to the inspiration of future astrophysicists' careers!*
