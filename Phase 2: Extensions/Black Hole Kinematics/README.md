# Black Hole Kinematics

Welcome maths and physicists, or people who want to play around with formulas. 
This extension is straightforward, use your knowledge and research in kinematics to simulate how black hole disks move against their core. Then compare your simulations to the obtained data.

*TIP: Base the comparison study to absorption lines.*
