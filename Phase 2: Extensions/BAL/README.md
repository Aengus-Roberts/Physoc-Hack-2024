# Study on Broad Absorption Light Quasars 

I see you like funny words! The BAL's extension is by far the best named challenge.

BALs stands for Broad Absorption Light quasars.
In this folder you can find a review paper that includes a good description of BALs.

BALs are black holes with fast outflows. In page 5 of the paper you can see that these black holes are surrounded by accretion disks (created by the matter which is falling in the black hole) which rotate at very high speeds. These disks are on their turn surrounded by shells and clouds of interstellar material (gas and dust). The energy released by the matter which falls onto the black hole (mainly emitted in the form of radiation) is absorbed by this gas which heats up to very high temperatures. This leads to an enlargement of emission lines (broadening).

We are not yet sure why BALs exist, but there have been a few studies on correlated properties between them. Use our data to tell us more about the correlations between BALs and how they might differ from other quasars. Maybe you will find some very cool stuff!

*TIP: Research selection effects of BALs to see if they correlate to what you find in your search and to check if you find anything new!*
