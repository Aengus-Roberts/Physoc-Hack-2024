# Eco Mapping

Eco mapping, also known as reverberation mapping is an old but still often used technique.

In reverberation mapping, astronomers observe variations in the brightness of the continuum emission from the accretion disk surrounding the black hole, as well as the corresponding variations in the emission lines from the BLR. When the continuum emission from the accretion disk brightens or dims, the response of the emission lines from the BLR is delayed due to the time it takes for the ionizing radiation from the accretion disk to reach the BLR and for the emission lines to respond.

By measuring the time delay between the variations in the continuum emission and the corresponding variations in the emission lines, astronomers can infer the size of the BLR and the velocity of the gas within it. This provides valuable information about the structure and dynamics of the BLR, as well as the mass of the central black hole and its accretion rate.
